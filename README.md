Pump.Fun - Decentralized Pump Events

Overview

Pump.Fun is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to create and buy  specific tokens. Users can pool funds to collectively "pump" the price of a token within a specified timeframe and share profits based on their contributions. The token creation in this application uses a bonding curve model.

This README outlines the project structure, setup instructions, and usage guidelines for developers and users.
Project Structure

The project is organized into three main directories:

smart-contracts: Contains the Solidity smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

frontend: Houses the React-based frontend for the dApp.

backend: Contains the Node.js backend for handling API interactions and off-chain logic.
